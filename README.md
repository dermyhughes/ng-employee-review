# Dermot Hughes | Angular Test

This project is a test of Angular 5 to create an app that you can add, remove and edit employees and add performance reviews.

I have had no experience with Angular or TypeScript before this project and my learning is based off the Angular courses by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy.

## Development server

Run `npm install` to install dependencies. 

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
